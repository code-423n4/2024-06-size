[06/10/2024 15:03] aviggiano
I was thinking about starting with a brief explanation of what Size is, then following up with the code structure, going through each of our core functions, and finalizing with the biggest areas of concern.

[06/11/2024 12:12] aviggiano (pinned)
Sure

As explained during the walkthrough (and also in the docs of ISize.sol), some operations (buy credit, sell credit, compensate), expect a credit position ID as input parameter so that you can buy an existing credit (from a lender), sell an existing credit (to a credit buyer), or compensate your debt from another loan you have. 

The special ID of `RESERVED_ID = type(uint256).max` can also be passed to represent "create a credit/debt pair" and execute the buying/selling/compensation operation at the same time.

This is used for example to do a simple lend with `buyCreditMarket(RESERVED_ID)`, do a simple borrow with `sellCreditMarket(RESERVED_ID)` or partially repay a loan with `compensate(RESERVED_ID)` + `repay`

This is also explained here

https://docs.size.credit/technical-docs/contracts/3.3-market-orders

> Observation: thanks to its robust API, both existing and new credit may be sold through the SellCreditMarket function. By passing type(uint256).max as the creditPositionId, the system first creates a DebtPosition/CreditPosition pair assigned to the sender, in a "mint credit" internal operation, and then sells that CreditPosition to the lender. If an existing credit position is being sold, the tenor parameter is ignored, as it can be automatically computed from the related debt position.

> Observation: thanks to its robust API, here too, both existing and new credit may be bought through the BuyCreditMarket function. By passing type(uint256).max as the creditPositionId, the system first creates a DebtPosition/CreditPosition pair assigned to the borrower, in a "mint credit" internal operation, and then buys that CreditPosition to the sender. If an existing credit position is being bought, both the tenor and  borrower parameters are ignored, as these can be automatically computed from the related debt and credit positions.

Not Applicable.

Any particular instances where this raises a question?

I usually mark N/A for documentation purposes of input validation fields that in reality do not need input validation. For example, in `validateClaim`, there's a `N/A` for `msg.sender`, since claim can be performed by anyone, as it is a permissionless method.

delete the complete project. 
1. sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade git
2. foundryup
3. clone the git repo
4. instead of forge install, try 'forge coverage'. forge coverage automatically installs the dependencies. lastly use forge build.

Hi @aviggiano  I have a question regarding claim function: in the code-walkthrough video you said that the lender does not necessarily have to call claim function immediately and therefore can earn additional yield from Aave, however you also said that anyone can claim on behalf of someone else, or that the protocol has its own bots to claim for other lenders. What happens if I as a lender want to leave the debt repayment (not claim it) and earn yield from Aave but someone else / bot claims it for me? Is there any minimum or maximum time that I can leave my repayment unclaimed?


[06/11/2024 19:40] aviggiano (pinned)
Good question, I think I could have explained it during the walkthrough.

What happens is that nothing changes from the lender perspective.

The reason is that `claim` will only do an internal balance change from `address(this)` to `creditPosition.lender`, but since all USDC is already deposited on Aave (through `deposit` / `DepositTokenLibrary` / `NonTransferrableScaledToken`), all users' borrow tokens/cash already automatically earns variable interest by default.

Let's say there are two situations:

Situation I
1. repay
2. claim
3. pass time
4. withdraw

Situation II
1. repay
2. pass time
3. claim
4. withdraw

Both Situation I and Situation II will have the same output for the lender, since in Situation I, the time passage will directly credit `borrowAToken.balanceOf(lender)`, while in Situation II, it will credit `borrowAToken.balanceOf(address(this))`, but in the end the credit amount will be proportionally sent to the lender's account during the claim step.

(btw, this could be a nice fuzz test case 😉  we don't have that one)

Hey @aviggiano  had a doubt regarding the `liquidateWithReplacement` function. When a borrower corresponding to a particular lender is susceptible to liquidation, is the function being called by the protocol automatically to provide the lender with a healthy borrower or the lender needs to call the function themselves? 

Also, if mechanisms are already present to prevent the borrower from delaying the repayment of loan then how does the borrower become under-collateralized/ susceptible to liquidation ?

@aviggiano what is function `mulcticall` does. and what is `isMulticall` for


[06/12/2024 12:47] aviggiano
Hey

Sure, here's some explanation:

First, this function is guarded by the `KEEPER_ROLE`, which is a role assigned to protocol liquidation bots. These bots can both perform a regular `liquidate`, which is permissionless, or a `liquidateWithReplacement`, which is permissioned. So the first thing we should note is that if bots fail to call this function, for any reason, any liquidator can still call `liquidate` and make the lender whole, earning some incentive in the process.

Second, it is worth pointing out that "When a borrower corresponding to a particular lender" is not a completely accurate description of the most generic case of the protocol. The reason is that 1 credit seller (borrower) can have multiple credit buyers (lenders) in case the credit buyer resells part of their future cash flow (partial lender exit). For example, if a borrower picks a lender with `sellCreditMarket(RESERVED_ID)`, then the lender can exit with `sellCreditMarket(creditPositionId)`, and now the initial borrower may have 2 lenders. Check out test case `test_SellCreditMarket_sellCreditMarket_CreditPosition_credit_is_decreased_after_exit` and documentation entry https://docs.size.credit/technical-docs/contracts/2.2-loans#id-2.2.2.2-creditposition

Third, the purpose of `liquidateWithReplacement` is for the protocol to earn some additional cash when an underwater borrower can be replaced by a healthy borrower on the orderbook who might be willing to pay a higher rate than the original borrower. For example, suppose the initial borrower was paying 1% yearly. Some time passes, and they are now liquidatable. Due to different market conditions, the new borrow rates are up, and there are borrowers willing to pay 2% yearly. Because of this spread, the protocol can replace the underwater borrower with a new healthy borrower and keep the change. The situation for the lenders does not change anything, except that now they are to be repaid by a healthier borrower.

[06/12/2024 12:50] aviggiano
Can you explain what you mean by "if mechanisms are already present to prevent the borrower from delaying the repayment of loan"?

There are no mechanism to change the term of a loan. They all must be repaid by the due date. What happens if the borrower does not repay is that the loan becomes overdue and it can be liquidated.

The borrower becomes under-collateralized by either withdrawing collateral or by a collateral price change. More information about that here: https://docs.size.credit/technical-docs/contracts/3.5-liquidations#id-3.5.1-automatic-collateral-assignment


[06/12/2024 12:53] aviggiano
Basically,  `multicall` allows a user to submit multiple actions in a single transaction. This can be useful for liquidations, for example, where the liquidator calls deposit, then liquidate, then withdraw.

Check out `IMulticall.sol` for more details, and also test case `test_Multicall_liquidator_can_liquidate_and_withdraw`

The purpose of `isMulticall` is a flag to check if postcondition checks should be waived during a multicall operation. This is especially useful for `deposit`, so that a debt reduction operation can always succeed, no matter if the cap is reached or not. There's some docs about that on `Deposit.sol`

[06/12/2024 13:35] aviggiano
Oh. I believe I misread your message.
Yes, in a sense, liquidate/liquidateWithReplacement "prevent" the borrower from delaying the payment. More strictly, though, the liquidator will repay the loan on behalf of the borrower (so that the lenders can have their money back), and take the borrower's collateral (plus incentives) for not repaying by due date.

@aviggiano Can you provide a simple example(no fees) with `buyCreditMarket`, splitted on different stages by showing Alice, Bob and Carl's funds, credits, dept etc. And how are they connected if Alice is the borrower and Bob & Carl are the lenders


[06/12/2024 17:25] aviggiano (pinned)
Sure

For the sake of simplicity, assume no fees:

1. Alice deposits collateral and submits a `sellCreditLimit` specifying she wants to borrow at 20% yearly
2. Bob deposits cash and picks Alice's offer with `buyCreditMarket(alice, RESERVED_ID)`, lending $100 to Alice. Alice now owns a debt position `debtPositionId1` of $120 future value due 365 days from now, and her `debtToken` is incremented by the same amount, reducing her collateral ratio. Bob owns a credit position `creditPositionId1` of  $120, with the `debtPositionId` parameter pointing to Alice's debt position  `debtPositionId1`. This link is done in `AccountingLibrary.createDebtAndCreditPositions`
3. Bob now wants to sell his credit and submits a `sellCreditLimit` specifying that he wants to earn 25% yearly.
4. Carl wants to buy $30 worth of Bob's credit, and submits a `buyCreditMarket(_, creditPositionId1)`. Bob's credit is brought to present value at a 25% rate, and Carl needs to pay $30/1.25 = $24 in cash for a part of Bob's credit. Bob's credit is fractionalized in `AccountingLibrary.createCreditPosition`, and now Bob's credit position is reduced to $90 = $120-$30, and Carl owns a credit `creditPositionId2` worth $30.
5. After all these operations, both credit positions `creditPositionId1` and `creditPositionId2` have the same `debtPositionId` parameter equal to `debtPositionId1`, ie, referring to Alice, the initial borrower.
6. When Alice `repay`s, her $120 future value is deposited to the protocol. Then, both Bob and Carl (or anyone, since it is a permissionless method) can call  `claim` passing each of their respective credit position IDs. This will transfer cash from the protocol to the respective creditor. This way, Bob will get $90 in cash to his balance and Carl will get $30.

You can see a similar test case in `test_SellCreditMarket_sellCreditMarket_exit_properties`, but with different values and checks.


[06/12/2024 17:31] aviggiano
This example already shows some particularities of the Size protocol:

- In (1), Alice submits a `sellCreditLimit` wanting to borrow money. In (3), Bob too submits a `sellCreditLimit` wanting to exit part of his loan. So the same operation can be either used for a "simple borrow" or for a "loan exit". As the docs explains quite well, in both cases users are selling credit (aka future cash flow). So this may be future cash flow in the sense of a borrow or future cash flow that they are receiving from someone else (lender exiting)
- In (4), during the credit fractionalization, a critical invariant of the protocol must hold, which is that `SUM(credit) = futureValue`. As we have explained, there can be multiple creditors for the same loan, but if this sum is not exact, the protocol would be either printing money (ie, sum of amount to be received greater than amount to be repaid, if `>`) or not giving back to creditors at the due date (ie, sum of amount to be received lesser than the amount to be repaid, if `<`)
- In (4), as you may see in the code, the `borrower` parameter is not used. This is a bit confusing, but the reason is that you are buying an existing credit, so the actual storage value you should be looking at is `creditPosition.lender`. This was an API choice so that both "buy an existing credit" and "create & buy and existing credit" actions would happen at the same function. You can see that in `BuyCreditMarket.executeBuyCreditMarket`

What is the significance of the borrow token cap? It seems this cap is not really used anywhere except from a few functions that check if it hasn't been breached


[06/12/2024 20:11] aviggiano
The reason for the borrow token cap is to allow the protocol to have a "guarded launch", so that it can limit the supply as it grows. For example, in the beginning, while the TVL grows, the cap may be $1M in deposits, for example. However, as you may see, the protocol will still want to allow for debt reductions. So even if the cap is reached, all operations that increase the health of the system should be allowed (`CapLibrary.sol`)


[06/12/2024 20:14] stakog
Why is it important to limit the supply?

Projects may choose to do it for a number reason. Perhaps to prevent growing at a faster pace than its security/safety/trust, perhaps to prevent growing before a bug bounty program is in place, perhaps to allow only early adopters to participate in the beginning, etc.

When users submit sell credit limit offers (or borrow bids), they specify through their yield curve the rate that they want to sell credit (or borrow). When users submit buy credit limit orders (or loan offers), they specify through their yield curve the rate that they want to pay for credit (or lend). See more here:

What is the different between credit and debt position


[06/13/2024 01:31] .tinkering
Opposites. 

Owner of a debt pays back the owner of the corresponding credit at maturity.

Credit = future cashflow

If you (market) borrow / sell credit, you have a debt position. If you (market) lend / buy credit, you have a credit.

With exact amount in, it means you want exactly the *cash* amount to be considered (since this is a buy operation). In example 1, Candy wants to pay exactly $80 in present value.

With exact amount out (ie, exact amount in equals false), it means you want exactly the *credit* amount to be considered. In example 1, Candy wants to get exactly $88 in future value. So she will not pay $88, she will get $88


[06/13/2024 13:03] infectedfuture
for the Example 1, shouldnt Alice rather get: `($80 - $5) * 1.1 - $0.375 = $82.125` ? As she will also have to pay for the swap fees ?


[06/13/2024 13:06] infectedfuture
Also, if Candy pays exactly $80, where are the additional $2.x dollars of cash coming from?


[06/13/2024 13:22] dvrkzy999
Imagine I lend you 100$ with 5% annual rate for 1 year so in the end I will get 105$. I have 105$ worth of credit now.

I can sell some of that credit to someone but it will be at a discount (it won't count the $ accrued from the annual rate).  I will sell $10.5 worth of credit to Bob but for 10$ only (because of the discount). I get 10$ immediately and after the maturity ends Bob will get 10.5$. 

The idea is that I will get 10$ early instead of waiting a whole year and Bob will become something like a partial lender. He will give 10$ to receieve 10.5$ at maturity

Check out step 4 and you will get it https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/1247222125543162038/1250501231693271081


[06/13/2024 13:32] aviggiano
Hey
Thanks for spotting this.
There's a typo on this example. **Candy** gets $82.5 in **credit**. You can see from the calculation since, in general terms, credit = cash * (1 + rate), since to get the future value of cash you are applying the interest rate to the present value.

This is the same example as `test_BuyCreditMarket_buyCreditMarket_exactAmountIn_numeric_example`, you can check it out. I'll fix the docs.

[06/13/2024 13:42] aviggiano
Btw, a warden raised another issue with the docs wrt to the fragmentation fee.
Before, they said "which is why a fixed fee is charged to the exiting lender."

This is true on the context of a sellCreditMarket order. But in a BuyCreditMarket, the user responsible for the fragmentation is not the exiting lender, but instead the credit buyer.

The intended behavior is that the fragmentation fee is charged to the user causing the credit split (which is logical, if you think about it — "passive" users should not pay for a credit fractionalization). This means the taker/msg.sender.

I have updated the docs too

I think the correct number is "Candy gets $82.5 in credit". See here https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/1250806328579063888/1250812604553756833


[06/13/2024 18:56] aviggiano
Check out test case `test_BuyCreditMarket_buyCreditMarket_exactAmountIn_numeric_example` for this example.


[06/13/2024 19:00] bozwkd
```
Total Credit = (Amount Paid - 5$) * (1 + Interest Rate)
```


[06/13/2024 19:01] aviggiano
I think it's `*` instead of `+` there


[06/13/2024 19:03] bozwkd
It would be `+` cause `$82.5 = (80$ - 5$) * (1 + 0.10%)`


[06/13/2024 19:04] aviggiano
oh sorry


[06/13/2024 19:04] bozwkd
If it were with `*` it would be `$7.5 = (80$ - 5$) * (1 * 0.10%)`

@Docs Wolf When lender buy credit using `buyCreditMarket` , Who will pay the swapFee ?


[06/14/2024 15:49] tamayonft
Started a thread.


[06/14/2024 15:55] anmol.eth
if alice is holding credit , principal =100$, interest = 20%  it will be worth 120$ at expiry , she sells that credit at a discount of 15% to free up his USDC. In that case the credit buyer will pay 115$ to alice now and he will get 120$ at expiry.  

As we see here we do not have a split but alice is all settled withtout any future cashflow. Does credit buyer still need to pay the fragmentation fee ?

[06/14/2024 17:12] d_auditor
or is there something I am missing?


[06/14/2024 17:19] stakog
As I understand it the borrower gets the erc20 shares representing the USDC which actually sits in Aave, but now the borrower can call withdraw and get the USDC


[06/14/2024 17:24] aviggiano
Correct. When the borrower calls e.g. `sellCreditMarket`, or when a lender calls `buyCreditMarket`, the borrower gets aszUSDC. Then, the borrower must call `withdraw` to burn aszUSDC and get USDC converted 1:1


[06/14/2024 17:32] d_auditor
Thanks @aviggiano and @stakog


[06/14/2024 19:51] jovemjeune
@aviggiano So as I understand from the example 2.3.1.1 BuyCreditMarket when a partial amount of credit is bought both credit seller and credit buyer pay fragmentation fee with a slight difference and it is the fact that unlike credit buyer,the seller should pay more than fragmentation fee.He should pay fragmentation fee + swap fee.


[06/14/2024 19:52] radev_40364

[06/14/2024 19:56] aviggiano
Hey
Actually, in BuyCreditMarket, the buyer pays for fragmentation fees (since they are the msg.sender) and the seller pays for swap fees (since credit sellers always pay for swap fees).
The credit seller does not pay for fragmentation fee here.

So, I just confused by the example.In the example  Alice is the credit seller but after selling a part of her credit(80$) she gets 74.625$ in cash by paying swap fee 0.375$ and  $5 fragmentation fee.


[06/14/2024 20:09] aviggiano
You can see that the fragmentation fee is deducted from the credit buyer's "amount in" amount. The credit buyer puts $80, but gets only $75 worth of credit. This is why they are paying for the fees

But then, the credit seller gets the net amount of $75, minus swap fees. This "net amount" is what is plugged into his yield curve to determine the future value of cash.

[06/14/2024 20:22] aviggiano
No, it is correct here.

The reason why fragmentation fees are paid in collateral during a `Compensate` is that the borrower may not have any deposited cash. So we charge it in collateral instead. Check out `executeCompensate`

[06/15/2024 10:45] aviggiano
Yeah
Please note that `exactAmountIn` means opposite things in the context of `BuyCreditMarket` vs `SellCreditMarket`. 

During a buy operation, you are buying credit with cash. So the amount you are putting in is cash.
During a sell operation, you are selling credit for cash. So the amount you are putting in is credit.

Hi, why does maxCashAmountIn must be muldived if params.creditPositionId not RESERVED_ID?

```
maxCashAmountIn: params.creditPositionId == RESERVED_ID ? cashAmountIn : Math.mulDivUp(creditPosition.credit, PERCENT, PERCENT + ratePerTenor)
```


[06/17/2024 08:04] zarkk01
credit*1e18/(1e18 + rate) is like bringing the value of future money (credit) in today, supposedly that the cash will increase in ratePerTenor. So, if params.creditPositionId not RESERVED_ID this means that the credit (that the position already has) must be bringed in todays value depending on the ratePerTenor of the new credit position.

Does APR calculates the LOAN interest only or it will calculate the interest+loan+ any additional fees ?


[06/17/2024 09:24] gd.eth
I think it's just loan interest only 👀


[06/17/2024 09:27] 0xstalin
The APR determines how much interest to charge per year on X amount of Credit.
But, APR is not the loan's absolute interest. For example, if you have an APR of 15% and the loan's duration is 2 years. The loan's absolute APR (ratePerTenor) would be 30%, cause you'll pay 15% on interest each year, so, 2 years at 15%, that makes a 30% absolute interest for this loan

Hey good question
There is no replacement deadline, if you mean liquidateWithReplacement. So anyone can call liquidate and "bypass" protocol owned bots. This is by design to put the health of the system first and the profit of the protocol second

According to this pictures of FE, positions seem not be separted by terms and users. Are they gonna get matched automatically? You do not need to specify the deal?
@aviggiano


[06/17/2024 11:53] aviggiano
Pinging @Gao to get the exact frontend behavior. I think this will help solidify the understanding, but also note that the offchain algorithm to pick a limit order is out of scope. You can assume credit sellers and buyers can select any order they wish

Thanks for the kind reply!


[06/17/2024 12:08] aviggiano
This is the remaining of loan + interest. It starts off as the absolute debt amount (including interest), but then it gets decremented on repayment operations, such as in `repay`, `liquidate` and `compensate`


[06/17/2024 13:13] .tinkering
Yes, the best rate for the maturity selected by the user will chosen automatically. This will include aggregating multiple offers in the multicall in the case that they want to borrow more than is available in a single well-priced offer.

If RESERVE_ID is used:
- when SellingCreditMarket, caller(CreditSeller) is a borrower who wants to take a new loan... a.k.a borrowing
- when BuyingCreditMarket, caller (CreditBuyer) is a lender who wants to create a new loan ... a.k.a lending

[06/18/2024 02:50] 0xstalin
is basically used to differentiate when the market order is for a new CreditPosition (if RESERVER_ID is used), or, if the market order is for an existing CreditPosition (when params.creditPosition is not RESERVE_ID)

Hi, anyone know what is the return value of this?
```
state.oracle.priceFeed.getPrice()
```


[06/18/2024 07:16] thisvishalsingh
`state.oracle.priceFeed.getPrice()` fetches the current price of the asset from the oracle that will be return value. This price is used to convert the `debtTokenAmount` to the equivalent `collateralTokenAmount`.

also you can check into src/oracle/PriceFeed.sol

[06/19/2024 07:28] berndt_
Not a vulnerability but what's reasoning idea behind calling `validateVariablePoolHasEnoughLiquidity` on lending and borrowing? What if users legitimately want to borrow ATokens when liquidity in the VariablePool is very low (even if they can't immediately withdraw them) since yield would be high? Or is there some bigger-picture idea behind it?


[06/19/2024 07:46] 0xstalin
because if there is no liquidity in the VariablePool (ex: Aave), the borrowed tokens (szaUSDC) are practically unusable outside of the protocol, borrowedTokens are not transferable, they can only be withdrawn for the underlying  token (USDC), and all the USDC of the contracts is deposited in Aave, so, if Aave has not liquidity && the borrow is not reverted, the borrower would practically be paying interests on an unusable token for all the period of time till the Variable Pool gets enough liquidity to allow the borrower to withdraw the amount of borrowed tokens as USDC from it

{Reactions}
👍 (3) 

[06/19/2024 07:59] berndt_
Right, but there might be borrowers who are willing to hold `borrowATokens` even though they're not withdrawable or transferrable, simply because of the rebasing, if the yield is higher than the interest on the fixed loan. Ideally the market would sort itself out. On the other hand I understand that you want to protect borrowers from borrowing 'unusable' tokens. Not sure what the 'correct' thing to do is here

EDIT: not "getting dumped on"


[06/19/2024 08:08] 0xstalin
is not like they are dumped with the borrowToken, they are protected from borrowing when there is no liquidity to cash out the borrowToken for the underlying asset.

I see what you are saying, and I would say that the right thing to do is to prevent a borrower from borrowing when the VariablePool has not liquidity. I think is better to protect a user from something that would impact them negatively rather than allow them to do things they'd like to do at the expense of exposing a negative risk for such allowed behavior

In section - 3.3.2 Buy Credit Market Order (lending market order) - 
`The main use case has been envisioned for that is to allow borrowers to exit their positions before the due date, without forfeiting the full-term interest.`
Can somebody explain if this is correct?


[06/19/2024 11:42] aviggiano
This is a good point, but hard to enforce the desired behavior in reality. Although some users may "price in" the unsolvency risk of Aave, others would not. So we take the safer approach and stop all trades of cash to prevent users from getting "dumped" aUSDC if it is not redeemable for USDC

{Reactions}
👍 

[06/19/2024 11:43] aviggiano
After all, this is a ETH/USDC market, not a ETH/aUSDC one. The Aave deposit is just an yield optimization strategy.


[06/19/2024 11:46] aviggiano
It is correct because we expect more users to actively borrow than to actively lend. But this is just an expectation of the market behavior. Lenders can also submit buy credit market orders actively if they want. 

For a borrower exit, check out the Compensate entry on the docs.

In the buyCreditMarketParams and sellCreditMarketParams the exactAmountIn parameter signifies if the amountIn is cash or credit what does this mean and what happens in either scenario?


[06/23/2024 09:40] zkillua.dev
the first image: you create debt-credit Positions for borrower first (if reserved), then transfer the credit position to lender. if not reserved, just transfer the credit position to a lender.  In bothcases, transferring credit position to lender is common. hence you dont have "else".

I will try to answer  someone correct me if i'm wrong 

If you have a look into `buyCreditMarket` then it is creating a debt position for the borrower(picked from order book) and credit position for lender(msg.sender). Here we don't need to again create a creditPosition for lender. 

 In a else block if we already have debtPosition then we simple create another credit position for lender. 

But incase of `sellCreditMarket` This is the flow if I'm not wrong 

1. Borrower calls sellCreditMarket by picking lender from orderbook 
2.  Debt position for borrower is created, also Credit position for borrower(not lender) is created. This is little weird because we generally think that credit position should be for lender. 

3. Now After escaping if block, the credit owned by a borrower is sold to lender who had a limit order in orderbook by creating a new creditPosition for a lender. 

It is like borrower hold the credit position for instant and sell it immediately to desired lender.

correct, thanks for the contribution

About point (2), I agree this is weird.

The reason we create debt/credit to the msg.sender first, and then exit it to the `params.lender`, is that we can calculate the exact amount of future value the borrower wants on the previous logic of `getCashAmountOut` /`getCreditAmountIn`

On a previous design, we had this "create debtposition/creditposition pair" (or mint credit) operation on a separate function. It was called `mintCredit` and it would allow you to specify a future value and due date for the credit that you could later resell. But this would make it hard to perform a simple borrow exact, because of swap fees and rounding. So we internalized this mint credit to msg.sender operation in sellCreditMarket and compensate

hi guys i reading the docs and i was hoping to receive some clarification as i am a little confused. The docs say:
"For example, Jim lends 100 USDC at 5% interest for 12 months, so the future value of the loan is 105 USDC (the amount he'll receive 12 months from now). After 6 months, Jim exits to another lender, Kline, with an interest rate of 4%. Kline will now receive the 105 USDC from the borrower at maturity, and thus now has to pay Jim the discounted cash value 105 / (1 + 0.04 * 6/12) = 102.9 USDC. Kline's 102.9 goes to Jim now, who realizes a 2.9% profit on his initial 100 he lent out, and Kline collects his 105 (including the 2.1 USDC profit) upon repayment by the borrower. " If Jim exits his lending position to Kline, and the rate changes from 5% to 4%, then why does Kline still receive $105 instead of $104 at maturity?  If the rate changed to 4%, shouldn't kline receive $104 at maturity? why do the docs say he still receives $105 at a 4% interest rate?


[06/24/2024 09:12] stakog
Because from the borrower's point of view nothing changed. He still need to repay a future value of 105$. So 105$ in this situation (when one lender exits to another lender) can be considered a constant. Kline pays Jim 102.9$ and will receive from the borrower 105$ so from Jim's perspective he made 4% profit (actually 2% because half of the tenor has passed)

Think of it this way if Kline's interest is 5% he would have received 2.5 USDC for six months but in stead he got only 2.1 which is ~ 4% of 100 for six months

`SOLVENCY_02: SUM(credit) <= SUM(debt)`. Should this be `SUM(credit) >= SUM(debt)` instead?


[06/24/2024 12:46] aviggiano
Hey
good question
In reality, this should be explicitly equal. Any inequality between credit and debt is a big issue for the protocol.

- If credit > debt, it means creditors can take more money from what debtors owe. This is similar to printing money, and the protocol is not solvent
- If credit < debt, it means debtors owe more than what the other party can redeem later. This means debtors are been overcharged. It is less impactful than the previous inequality, but it is still bad

You can check in another invariant that a strict equality is also checked


[06/24/2024 12:52] pkqs90
If we take liquidation into account, credit > debt is also a valid case? Since liquidation decreases debt but doesn't change credit - credit is only reduced when the lender claims


[06/24/2024 12:55] paulbirnbaum
@aviggiano Why reduce the credit in the CreditPosition , create another CreditPosition and set the credit in it in BuyCreditMarket::executeBuyCredit ? 

In that way there is now 2 creditPosition with the same debtPositionId ? What's the matter ?


[06/24/2024 12:57] aviggiano (pinned)
Good point
In reality, the property definition is a bit simplified, just for the sake of making it obvious that we shouldn't be printing money. But the strict definition is "outstanding credit", which means credit from non-repaid loans. This is what is implemented in `Properties.sol`

Total credit can be different than debt as the lifetime of a loan goes by.

Example 1
1. Alice borrows $100 from Bob. Alice has 100 debt and Bob has 100 credit
2. Alice repays. Now Alice has 0 debt but Bob has 100 credit. So the strict equality does not hold, because Bob can now claim the repaid money

Example 2
1. Alice borrows $100 from Bob. Alice has 100 debt and Bob has 100 credit
2. Bob sells 30 of his credit to Candy. Now Alice has 100 debt, Bob has 70 credit, Candy has 30 credit. The strict equality holds because both Bob and Candy can claim their owed money when Alice repays

So if you take into account only non-repaid loans, the strict equality should always hold, otherwise you'd be printing money

Example 3 (buggy)
1. Alice borrows $100 from Bob. Alice has 100 debt and Bob has 100 credit
2. Bob sells 30 his credit to Candy. Now Alice has 100 debt, Bob has 71 credit, Candy has 30 credit, maybe because of a rounding error. This means money was printed, and it is a critical issue. After Alice repays, Bob+Candy would be entitled to more than what was repaid.

Hello @aviggiano , In the docs, in section "Illustration of Borrower Liquidation (w/ replacement borrower)", it states: "The advantage here is that we have more USDC (technically denominated in ETH) to pay back to Borrower A. In the previous example without a replacement borrower, there was a remainder of 510 USDC. Here we see 538 USDC. The keeper/liquidator and protocol earn a bit extra as well, and a bid from the Borrowing Bid Offer Book is filled while Lender A still receives the expected amount on the due date." I do not see how the liquidator and the Borrower A get more money back when compared to getting just liquidated. The only difference I see is that the protocol gets more money. Is the documentation wrong or am I missing something?. Thanks!

You take a loss on a loan you gave to a borrower but thereby you stop your exposure to this loan. So you cap the loss you take no the loan which could get even higher if the collateral value falls further

much thanks.
I am confused about this, self-liquidation has a limit of no more than 100% collateral ratios, 
so why not liquidate debt positions that are underwater before then, which may be more profitable.
Thank you I understand a little better now!


[06/27/2024 06:04] benrai
self-liquidation is mend to be used when no one else will liquidate the position becasue the liquidation is not profitable (cr < 100%). If a lender sees that his borrower is under water he can still call the "normal" liquidate and make a profit on the liquidation

Hey @aviggiano , Could you explain simply what is `assigned Collateral`, I understand the calculation behind it but don't really uderstand what it represent. 

As it's the `futureValue * collateral / debt and future value > debt `.
So by definition `Assigned Collateral > Collateral `


[06/27/2024 08:34] benrai
The debt here is not the debt of the position but the overall debt of the user. This means that `futureValue <= debt` and therefore `assignedCollateral <= collateral`.
If I have two borrowPositions, each with a futureValue/debt of 100 USD, my total debt would be 200 USD the assigned collateral for one position will be 50% of all my collateral

Ok, thanks I got it. 

But if the borrower has only one position, 
 `future value  =  (debt + Interest)` right? 
Therefore the futureValue is higher than the debt and `(futureValue / debt) > 1`? 
And so `assignedCollateral > collateral`?


[06/27/2024 12:50] gd.eth
futureValue is equal to the debt

Hey
`_setPrice(1e18)` is a quick way to create tests when 1 USDC = 1 WETH, so that you can treat collateral amounts the same as borrow amounts. In production, the price will be given by Chainlink on  `PriceFeed.sol`, with 18 decimal places.

[07/03/2024 04:18] 0xstalin
That’s like the final repo, validators will determine which reports from the validation’s repo are moved to the findings repo so judge and sponsor validates/judge the reports only from that repo

However, after communicating with the sponsor some possible attack vectors were confirmed to be invalid. 
I didn't think it was necessary to submit any more, and in the end I only submitted my confirmed results.


[07/03/2024 04:48] gd.eth
I didn't expect so many submissions. 🤣


[07/03/2024 04:49] alix40
I think if the code was low quality, with the number of people participated we would have had 1.5 k submissions xD. So 800 are the submissions and probably have a lot of duplicates


[07/03/2024 04:51] gd.eth
Wow, that's a lot of work.


[07/03/2024 07:20] pascal9476
Is there a way to know if your finding has moved from validator repo to main repo


[07/03/2024 07:21] .nnez
Only if you have SR role

depends on a ratio,  for auditors with good valid ratio go directly to findings, the others go to the validate repo

{Reactions}
🙏 (3) 👀 

[07/21/2024 17:00] saba1914
i.e one of those concern i believe regarded the `BuyCreditMarket` or sell market functions in the Size Protocol and its lack of verification for whether the borrower and lender are the same address, if this could indeed be intentional, depending on the design philosophy of the protocol. Some protocols might allow such interactions for specific reasons, such as enabling more flexible liquidity provisions or internal balancing mechanisms. However, it's also possible that this could be an oversight, potentially leading to undesirable behaviors like self-dealing or manipulation

1/2 findings for arabgodx and few other warden i believe is anyone able to verify it inside this PJQA ? Saw someone banish some of this finding for low info/qa and some will awarded duplicate medium finding if the issue is wrong parameter or non protocol fault

correct me if im wrong but, i thought c4 moved towards only awarding the top 3 QA reports? if that is the case, what is the purpose of giving QA reports grade a/grade b etc?


[07/22/2024 14:32] thebrittfactor
You're correct that we're only awarding the top 3 QA reports, marked by 1st/2nd/3rd place. However, in the rare event there are no H/Ms, the grades will be used to score and award (unless otherwise stated). More details [here](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards/curve-logic#if-there-are-no-valid-hm-findings).

I believe you can't, those are only accessible backstage wardens


[07/23/2024 22:32] ubl4nk
I think my findings are not even moved by validators to judge repo.

Very unfair judging mechanism, i won't participate in any contest anymore in Code4rena.

Both validation & findings repos are typically made public when the report is published.


[07/23/2024 23:06] ubl4nk
I spent ~50 hours on this codebase and 3/4 my findings was confirmed by sponsor, now i see only 1 Med is accepted.

I don't know what is happened during the judgements.

It is not all about the hardworking, hardworking will be useless in an unfair situation (where you can't even escalate your issue without backstage).

There are a lot of senior wardens who miss some bugs.
I'm curious as a high level auditor what types of bugs they miss and how to avoid them?


[07/24/2024 05:06] samuraii77
these reward calculations didn't do me a favour 🥲


[07/24/2024 05:17] velislav4o4298

You're right, it's not fair that some people can't escalate their findings

I participated in this contest, and submitted 5 findings total, but I can't see my account in leaderboard.
What's happening?

[07/25/2024 17:20] petro_1912
Even if all findings are invalid, I'll still be able to see my account on the leaderboard, right?


[07/25/2024 17:23] petro_1912
I haven't backstage access yet. Anyone can help me? 
my account is petro_1912 on the C4.
